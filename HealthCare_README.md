# Healthcare-Conundrum
This is a timed team assessment. We worked on regression analysis during class on a dataset we have not seen before. 
CHICKEN & MEAT CO. - A Report

Chicken & Meat co should absorb the high premium despite the costs as it is unfair for the organization to charge all the employees just because Arkansas poultry was brought into the group. It is true that Arkansas plant has greater annual health expenditure because of the age and smoking demographics of its employees, i.e., almost 80% of its employees are above the age 35 and has 44% of overall smokers. Thus, the company should try to absorb the premiums so that the other plants’ employees do not get affected. As there are some tax benefits included towards the premiums paid for the employees, it is not a very bad scenario for the company. However, the company should focus on upbringing the health awareness amongst its employees so that their insurance costs decrease in the long run.

•	We recommend the company to conduct regular health check-up camps, incentives to encourage healthy lifestyles ex. like gifts/ rewards for employees who will local marathons.
•	Conduct awareness programs and sports events that can also improve the employees’ relationships.
•	Maintaining a good BMI index can also improve the employee’s performance, thus it can be encouraged to provide them with good holidays/ breaks.

We observed that smoking, age, and BMI are the major attributes that impact the cost, which have the highest coefficients respectively. We also observed that gender did not impact the analyses which states that both females and males had similar lifestyle habits that led to greater medical bills. We also observed that the number of children cause higher medical costs too.
